Start up directions: To start the program you need to follow the following path:
			"\FilmsLibrary\FilmsLibrary\bin\Debug\FilmsLibrary.exe"

How does the program work: When you start the program the following menu shows up:<br>
			1. Add new film<br>
			2. Remove film<br>
			3. Update film<br>
			4. Fetch film<br>
			5. Filters<br>
			6. Exit<br>
From here you choose what to do. By typing the number in front of a function you can add a new film to the database, you can remove a film, update a film etc.
When you choose "Filters" another menu shows up:<br>
			1. Films sorted by title<br>
			2. Films sorted by actor<br>
			3. Films sorted by genre<br>
			4. Back to main menu<br>
			5. Exit<br>
From here you decide in what way you want the films to be listed and of course there a "Back to main menu" option which brings you back to the main menu.
